      "post": "Dogs are considered by many to be man’s best friend, and a lot of us love to wonder about exactly what our loyal and energetic companions are thinking or what they would say to us if they were talking animals. The Texts From Dog Tumblr offers answers to these questions with a modern twist – as the name suggests, the blog is all about the imaginary SMS exchange between a talking dog and his owner.",

      "post": "\"Man's best friend\" is a common phrase used to describe domestic dogs, referring to their millennia-long history of close relations, loyalty, friendship, and companionship with humans. The first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden Nash and has since become a common colloquialism.",
